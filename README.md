Slide Presentation: Testables LA Meetup for April, 2020


This is an html slide presentation for April, 2020 Meetup


https://github.com/schlezes/April-testables-meetup/blob/master/opening-page-of-presentation.png

This presentation consists of three files:

   1.  The index.html
   2.  The main.js
   3.  The img-src directory
   
All of the artwork is contained in the img-src directory.

The index.html rendering presents the initial page.

After that a click event on any of the numbered buttons will trigger an action fuction to render the contents of the li object associated with the button.

There are two rows of buttons as follows:

    top row for slide statment (or comment) numbered 1 - 23
    second row for slide artwork to backup or empahsise the above statement of the first row numbered 31 - 53.
    the initial class setting for the second row of buttons is color: white and background-color: white
    - so that this second row of artwork slides does not give the impression of excessive slide set.
    
Click on the slide set button li to render the slide content.
 
 You can view the artwork files by clicking each item of the img-src directory.
 
 You may download these files into your browser and run.
 
 thanks,
 
 Vince Schlezes
